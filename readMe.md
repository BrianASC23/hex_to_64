Hexadecimal To Base64

The purpose of this project was to complete Cybersecurity Club's challenge. 

Description

Bits and binary are two completely different things. Bits are items that can be 1s or 0s that STORE information. Binary is the state itself. The 1 and 0. Bits dive much deeper into the actual information. In this program, I created a program in Python to convert a Hexadecimal to a Base 64 through operations on the raw bytes. The reason, why I am operating on raw bytes is to help myself understand how bytes and bits can modify, encode, decode information and provide a foundation for computers to run on. The actual usage and large-scale bit stored information is actually used in the electronics.
